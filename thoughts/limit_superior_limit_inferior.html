		<h3>Limit Superior and Limit Inferior</h3>

		<p>
		Somehow or another I cannot manage to retain the
		properties of the limit superior in my head for
		more than ten minutes. This has been plaguing me
		for <i>years</i>. I am writing this blog to help me
		understand and remember these operations, and their
		significance in applied mathematics.
		</p>
		<hr>

		<p>
		A general sequence may accumulate to a certain
		point, or to many points, or to no points. The limit
		superior is the largest point about which a
		sequence accumulates around. The limit inferior is
		the smallest point about which a sequence accumulates.
		</p>

		<p>
		Now, the limit superior is not necessarily equal to
		the largest point in the sequence. The limit
		superior may not exist in the sequence. Furthermore,
		there may be points in the sequence that are larger
		than the limit superior. This is expounded next.
		</p>

		<p>
		The limit superior is not necessarily equal to the largest
		point in the sequence. The limit superior is the largest point
		<i>which a sequence accumulates around</i>. That is, the limit
		superior is the largest of all points that occur infinitely
		often in the sequence. There may be larger values than the
		limit superior in the sequence, but only finitely many of
		these values.
		</p>

		<p>
		<i>
		The above exposition is imprecise.
		Technically, there may be infinitely many terms
		greater than the limit superior. However, within
		an arbitrarily small distance above 
		the limit superior, there can be only finitely
		many points. So we can say that the series
		does not stay significantly above the limit
		superior for ever &mdash; eventually, one will
		fall close to it in a certain sense. The sense
		depends on context.
		</i>
		</p>

		<p>
		The converse is true for the limit inferior.
		</p>

		<p>
		The limit superior and limit inferior are quite
		closely related. For instance, in set theory,
		the complement of the limit superior of a sequence
		is equivalent to the limit inferior of the
		complement sequence. For real numbers, the limit
		superior of a negated sequence is equivalent to
		the negated limit inferior. There is a sort of
		symmetry here.
		</p>

		<p>
		The limit superior and limit inferior can be
		used to define limits. The limit of a sequence
		can be defined as the value of the limit
		superior or the limit inferior when the limit
		superior and the limit inferior are equivalent.
		Where the limit superior and limit inferior are
		not equal, the limit does not exist.
		</p>

		<p>
		The limit superior and limit inferior can
		conveniently be defined in terms of
		<i>tail sequences</i>. Consider an arbitrary
		sequence. Now throw away the first n terms of
		the sequence. The remaining sequence is the
		n<sup>th</sup> tail sequence, or the remaining terms of
		the original sequence.
		</p>

		<p>
		Now the limit superior can be defined with
		tail sequences. The limit superior is the
		limit (as n grows large) of the supremum value 
		of the n-th tail sequence. So as the tail
		sequence shrinks, each sequence will have some
		sort of supremum, or upper bound. The limit
		of these values is the limit supremum.
		</p>

		<p>
		The sequences of the supremum's is strictly
		decreasing. Therefore, the limit of this
		sequence is equivalent to the infimum of the
		sequence. The limit superior is therefore
		the infimum of the tail sequences's supremums.
		</p>

		<p>
		The converse is true of the limit inferior
		as well. The limit inferior is defined as
		the supremum of the tail sequence's infimums.
		</p>

		<p>
		The limit superior may not be defined. This
		is a technical point, which I am still
		learning about. But for sequences of real
		numbers, if the underlying space is not
		<i>complete</i>, the limit superior may 
		not exist. For sequences of sets, if the
		space is not a <i>complete lattice</i>, then
		the limit superior may not exist. From what
		I currently understand, some notion of
		completeness needs to be defined on the
		underlying space for the limit superior
		and limit inferior to exist. I think that
		this is why analysts will introduce the extended
		real numbers (as opposed to just working with the
		real numbers).
		</p>

		<p>
		The properties of limit superior and limit
		inferior result in some neat properties that
		I will briefly state.
		<ul>
			<li>
			The limit inferior is always less than
			or equal to the limit superior.
			</li>
			<li>
			In general, the limit superior is less
			than or equal to the supremum of the sequence.
			</li>
			<li>
			A sequence converges if and only if
			the limit superior equals the limit
			inferior. The above is true assuming
			the underlying space is complete in
			some sense.*
			</li>
			<li>
			The limit superior is subadditive.
			The limit inferior is superadditive.
			The limit superior and limit inferior
			will be additive when one of the
			sequences converges. The above is
			true assuming infinity is never
			subtracted from infinity.
			</li>
		</ul>
		</p>

		<p>
		* The details of completeness are not completely
		clear to me currently. Although I understand
		completeness of the real numbers, and analogous
		ideas of complete lattices are clear, I do not
		understand how these ideas generalize to
		arbitrary sequences yet, or how it connects to
		the idea of <i>order</i>. This is something
		to look into in the future.
